# Practice Teaching and Giving Feedback

Goals of this teaching practice:

- In groups of 4-5 persons we will practice teaching a **5-minute segment
  of a lesson of your choice**.
- The section you pick should require **screen sharing** and be of some
  **demonstration or follow-along task** (preferably using a shell) to also
  practice having a good screen-sharing setup.
- After each presentation, other group members give feedback with the same 2x2 rubric 
  as used in {doc}`interactive-teaching`.  
- We will practice improving our 5-minute segment by taking the feedback into account.
- In both sessions you can teach the same topic/segment but if you prefer you can also
  change the topic/aspect for the second session.

```{challenge} Live coding exercise (50 min)
- We organize the breakout rooms to not only discuss one lesson/topic so that it is more interesting
  to listen and also probably we will all get more useful feedback.
- Give each other **constructive verbal feedback** on the teaching demos
  using [this demo rubric](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric.html).
- Write down questions (in the collaborative document) that you would like to
  discuss in the main room or interesting conclusions which you would like to
  share with others.
```

## Discussion

```{discussion} Main room discussion (10 min)
- We discuss questions and conclusions which came up during the group work session.
