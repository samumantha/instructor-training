ENCCS instructor training
=========================

This ENCCS instructor training material is focused on helping competent practitioners
and experts teach their knowledge to others. It also serves a
kickstart to teaching ENCCS lessons.

The material presented here is partly derived from two instructor training resources 
developed in the `CodeRefinery project <https://coderefinery.org/>`__ as well as the instructor 
training lesson from `The Carpentries <https://carpentries.org/>`__:

- `CodeRefinery Community Teaching <https://coderefinery.github.io/community-teaching/>`__
- `CodeRefinery Instructor Training <https://coderefinery.github.io/instructor-training/>`__
- `Carpentries Instructor Training <https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/>`__

Inspiration has also been drawn from the free online book 
`Teaching Tech Together <https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html>`__ by Greg Wilson.

After attending a workshop covering this material, learners should:

- Have increased confidence in teaching interactive workshops in online and in-person settings.
- Be familiar with important pedagogical concepts and scientific findings about how people learn 
  new skills.
- Appreciate the importance of frequent hands-on practice in building skill. 
- Understand how learning can be improved by following certain best practices in interactive teaching.
- Know how to backwards-design training material based on intended learning outcomes.
- Know about important differences between online and in-person training and how inherent challenges 
  in online training can be overcome.
- Be familiar with a technical approach to collaboratively developing open source lessons based 
  on a template.



.. prereq::

   This course has no strict prerequisites, but

   * It is helpful if you have attended an ENCCS or CodeRefinery
     workshop, which are taught in an interactive and hands-on way.

   * We assume you already have competence in the technical topics and tools you
     want to teach.

   * While not a prerequisite for this course, version control (Git)
     is necessary to contribute to lesson development the way we show
     here (but the lesson design concepts are applicable to other
     styles, too).

Who is the course for?
----------------------

Teaching is a profession, but also something that everyone needs to be
able to do to some degree, since everyone has their own personal
specialties they will either teach or mentor.

This course can be relevant for different learner personas:

- **You run a practical teaching program** at your institution (for example
  as part of a research computing group) and would like to learn best
  practices for collaborative teaching of technical topics, so that you aren't re-inventing
  the same thing over and over again.

- **You are a technical specialist** who is frustrated with the way you
  currently try to teach others who need to use your software or
  infrastructure.  You can't spend too much time to become a
  professional, but you know you need something more than what you've
  been doing.  Thus, you would like to adopt some of the best practices of
  designing and teaching interactive, hands-on workshops.

- **You've been teaching alone**, but would like to join a collaboration
  network for more co-teaching and to reduce the amount of duplication
  of effort.

- **You are interested in teaching ENCCS lessons**, and would like a
  comprehensive kick-start to how ENCCS workshops work, either to join us,
  or teach our lessons with us or independently.


About the course
----------------

This course gives an introduction to

* Science and philosophy of teaching.
* How to teach interactive, hands-on workshops.
* How to design interactive, hands-on lessons.
* How ENCCS has taken the best advantage of online teaching.
* How ENCCS runs workshops.
