```

## Goals for this workshop

- **Inspire teachers and staff who teach technical topics:** Use best practices, especially for online teaching.
- **Promote collaboration in teaching**.
- **Motivate new instructors** to take up our lessons, remix them, and to contribute.
- **Get feedback** to improve the material as well as our collaboration model.
- **Catalyze and form new networks** and collaborations of teachers and trainers of
  practical scientific computing.


### Giving confidence

> *Goal number one should be that we give participants the confidence to
> independently apply the tools or knowledge learnt. This is more important
> that giving a "complete" overview.* [Lucy Whalley gave this great comment at a CodeRefinery workshop]

We strive to follow the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
to foster an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.

In short:
- Use welcoming and inclusive language

## First teaching practice

Before commencing the walkthrough of this instructor training material, we will try to create a mental reference point to how we currently approach teaching, and also to how we currently provide feedback to other teachers. At the very end of the workshop we will have a similar exercise, and it will be interesting to compare our experiences before and after covering the lesson. 

```{challenge} Initial teaching and feedback experience (10 minutes)

- In groups of two, take turns to "teach" a topic close to your heart to your collaborator. This can be a topic you know well, that you've taught before, or that you want to teach in the future.
- Keep it short, around 3-5 minutes. Try to be concrete and hands-on. It can involve shell commands, programming, navigating a graphical user interface or using a computational tool.
- The other person listens and optionally tries to type along (if relevant) 
- The listener then provides feedback on the teaching. What went well, what could be improved?
- Now swap roles and repeat.
```

```{discussion} Main room discussion (10 minutes)

- What was difficult during the teaching demo? 
- Did you make mistakes that you immediately became aware of?
- How did it go when providing feedback, could you think of constructive criticism?
