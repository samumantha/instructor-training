<section id="working-with-learning-objectives">
<h3>Working with learning objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-learning-objectives" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>ENCCS lessons usually have a <em>learning objectives</em> section.
Good learning objectives are quite specific about the intended effect of a lesson on its learners.
We aim to create learning objectives that are specific, accurate, and informative for
both learners and instructors.</p>
<p>In practice, it’s best to start defining your target audience by answering to questions
such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>What is the expected educational or skill level of my audience?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have they been already exposed to the technologies I am planning to teach?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>What tools do they already use?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>What are the main issues they are currently experiencing?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you clarified your target audience, it is useful to create
<strong>learner personas</strong>. This will help you during the development process by
providing concrete examples of potential learners showing up at your
workshops.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For each <strong>learner persona</strong>, try to think of what is <strong>useful to them</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>What do they <strong>need</strong> to remember/understand/apply/analyze/evaluate/create (see Bloom’s taxonomy below).</p></li>
<li><p>Then, you create a sequence of exercises which test incrementally
progressing tasks and acquisition of the new skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, you write material to teach the gap between exercises.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Using Bloom’s Taxonomy to write effective learning objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#using-bloom-s-taxonomy-to-write-effective-learning-objectives" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/">Bloom’s Taxonomy</a> is a framework for
thinking about learning that breaks progress down into discrete, hierarchical steps.
While many ideas have come and gone in education, Bloom’s has remained a useful tool for educators,
in particular because the
hierarchy seems to be reasonably valid: outcomes at the top of the hierarchy cannot be achieved
without mastery of outcomes at
the bottom.</p>

<section id="memory-management">
<h2>Memory management<a class="headerlink" href="#memory-management" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Learning involves memory. For our purposes, human memory can be divided into two different
layers, <strong>long-term</strong> and  <strong>short-term</strong>.
Long-term memory, which we use to store persistent information, is essentially unbounded but is
slow to access. Short-term memory (also called working memory), which we use to actively think
about things, is much faster but also much smaller. It has been estimated that the average
adult’s short-term memory can hold 7±2 items for a few seconds before things start to drop out.</p>

<p>If we present our learners with large amounts
of information, without giving them the opportunity to practice using it (and thereby
transfer it into long-term memory), they will not retain the material as well as if we
present small amounts of information interspersed with practice opportunities.</p>
<p>When designing lessons we can try to maximise memory retention through a number of strategies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Chunking</strong>: Our minds can store larger numbers of facts in short-term memory by creating
chunks, or relationships among separate items, allowing them to be remembered as a single
item. Connecting information makes it easier to remember.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Formative assessment to support memory consolidation</strong>: Formative assessment helps
learners solidify their understanding and begin transferring ideas into long-term memory.
Limitations of short-term memory are one reason why assessments should be frequent: short-term memory is limited not only in space, but also in time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Group work</strong>: Elaboration (explaining your work) supports transfer to long-term
memory. This is one reason why teaching is one of the most effective ways to learn! Group
work can feel uncomfortable at first and consumes time in a workshop, but learners often
rate group work as a high point for both enjoyment and learning in a workshop.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Opportunities for reflection</strong>: Reflection is another tool that can help learners review
things they have learned, strengthen connections between them, and consolidate long-term
memories. Asking learners for feedback can be an effective consolidating prompt as providing
feedback demands some reflection on what has been learned.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Counting new concepts</strong>:  It is important to limit the number of concepts introduced in a lesson, but
this can be hard! Planning your lesson with a concept map can help you not only identify key
concepts and relationships, but also to notice when you are trying to teach too many things at
once.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition-formative-and-summative-assessment callout admonition" id="callout-0">
<p class="admonition-title">Formative and summative assessment</p>
<p><em>Formative assessment</em> takes place during teaching and learning. It sounds like
a fancy term, but it can be used to describe any interaction or activity
that provides <strong>feedback to both instructors and learners about learners’ level of understanding</strong>
of the material. For learners, this feedback can help focus their study efforts. For instructors, it
allows them to refocus their instruction to respond to challenges that learners are facing.
Used continuously.</p>
<p><em>Summative assessment</em> is used to judge whether a learner has reached an acceptable level of competence.
Usually, at the end of a course learners either “pass” or “fail” a summative assessment.</p>

<section id="designing-formative-assessment">
<h2>Designing formative assessment<a class="headerlink" href="#designing-formative-assessment" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Well designed formative assessment tasks – i.e. quick questions and exercises –
can go a long way towards correcting misconceptions and expanding the mental models of learners.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions to keep in mind when designing exercises:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Not every exercise has to be an amazing hand-on example. Mixing with smaller, more conceptual
things can reduce <a class="reference external" href="https://enccs.github.io/instructor-training/interactive-teaching/#cognitive-load">cognitive load</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to make your exercises relevant, meaningful and connected to previous knowledge.
Connect the exercises to the real world. When learners understand the meaning of new concepts
it will be easier for them to remember.</p></li>
<li><p>Create more involved exercises that can be optional for more advanced learners.
This is a way to meet the needs of participants with a wide range of background knowledge.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Good exercises are the most important factor in a good lesson</strong>. Even if you are preparing the rest of
the lesson mostly alone, consider a good long brainstorming session to go from “list of topics to
cover” to “sequence of exercises”.</p>
<p>When you are stuck thinking “how can I make an exercise that covers X”, look through the lists below for
inspiration. Not every exercise has to be an sophisticated hands-on thing, so don’t be afraid to use
different types:</p>
<p><strong>Types of exercises</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Multiple choice (easy to get feedback via a classroom tool; try to design each wrong answer so that it identifies a specific misconception).</p></li>
<li><p>Code yourself (traditional programming).</p></li>
<li><p>Code yourself + multiple choice to see what the answer is (allows you to get feedback).</p></li>
<li><p>Minimal fix (given broken code, make it work).</p></li>
<li><p>Parsons problems (working solution but lines in random order, learner must “only” put them in proper order).</p></li>
<li><p>Fill in the blank, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worked-example_effect">faded problems</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Tracing execution.</p></li>
<li><p>Tracing values through code flow.</p></li>
<li><p>Reverse execution (find input that gives an output).</p></li>
<li><p>Theme and variations (working code, adapt to other type of situation/problem).</p></li>
<li><p>Refactoring.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a diagram.</p></li>
<li><p>Label diagram.</p></li>
<li><p>Matching problem: two sets of Q/A, match them.</p></li>

<p class="admonition-title">Using formative assessment to identify misconceptions</p>
<p>Formative assessment can be used to tease out misconceptions using for example multiple choice
questions (MCQ). When designed carefully, MCQs can target anticipated misconceptions with surgical
precision.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we are teaching children multi-digit addition. A well-designed MCQ could be:</p>
<p>Q: what is 27 + 15 ?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a) 42</p></li>
<li><p>b) 32</p></li>
<li><p>c) 312</p></li>
<li><p>d) 33</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What misconceptions do the wrong answers reveal?</p>
<div class="admonition-solution solution important dropdown admonition" id="solution-0">
<p class="admonition-title">Solution</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the child answers 32, they are throwing away the carry completely.</p></li>
<li><p>If they answer 312, they know that they cannot just discard the carried ‘1’, but do not understand that it is actually a ten and needs to be added into the next column. In other words, they are treating each column of numbers as unconnected to its neighbors.</p></li>
<li><p>If they answer 33 then they know they have to carry the 1, but are carrying it back into the same column it came from.</p></li>

<li><p>Create your question. How many choices can you think of that will diagnose a specific misconception?</p></li>

<p>Type your question into the shared document and explain the diagnostic power of each choice.

<p class="admonition-title">Design a faded example (10 min)</p>
<p>This exercises assumes that you are teaching a technical topic like programming or similar.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Try to design a faded example, i.e. an example code where learners should fill in the blanks.</p></li>
<li><p>Think of the level of your learners. How much would you fade out for a novice? How about a
competent practitioner?</p></li>
<li><p>How did you decide what to fade out?</p></li>
<li><p>Present your example in a small group and let others in your team guess which level you intended
the example for!</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When designing exercises, consider that some participants will get stuck
and may want to re-join at a later exercise. In other words it is nice
if exercises build up on each other but not at the cost that if participants
get stuck at exercise 2, they will not be able to do exercises 3 to N.</p>

<li><p>Robert is a field ecologist who obtained his PhD 6 months ago. He is now
working on a new project with Climate scientists and as a consequence will
need to run global climate models. He is <strong>not very familiar with command
line</strong> even though he attended a Software Carpentry workshop and the idea to
use HPC is a bit terrifying. He knows that he will get support from his
team who has extensive experience with HPC but would like to become more
independent and be able to <strong>run his own simulations</strong> (rather than copying
existing cases).</p></li>
<li><p>Jessica is a postdoc working on a project that investigates numerically the
complex dynamics arising at the tip of a fluid-driven rupture. Fluid
dynamics will be computed by a finite element method solving the
compressible Navier-Stokes equations on a moving mesh. She <strong>uses a code she
has developed</strong> during her PhD and that is based on existing libraries. She
has mostly ran it on a local desktop; her work during her PhD was very
limited due to the lack of computing resources and she is now very keen is
<strong>moving to HPC</strong>; she knows that it will requires some work, in particular to
parallelize her code. This HPC training will be her first experience with
HPC.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Learning outcomes</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Understand the difference between HPCs and other local/remote machines</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the notion of core, nodes, cluster, shared/distributed memory, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the notion of login nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the need for a scheduler and how to use it appropriately</p></li>
<li><p>Understand why optimising I/O is important on HPC and how to best use HPC filesystems</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the need to parallelize (or use existing parallel) codes and in which cases HPCs is a must (when communications is required)</p></li>
<li><p>Understand how to get your code ready to use on HPC (access to libraries, installation of your own libraries/software, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Understand that an HPC is an operational machine and is not meant for developing codes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercises</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Get basic information such the number of CPUs, memory from your laptop and try to do the same on a HPC. Discuss outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to create files on the different filesystems on your HPC resource and access them.</p></li>
<li><p>Create different types of job scripts, submit and check outputs.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a concrete example to run a specific software on your HPC (something like GROMACS).</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="admonition-title">Backwards-design a lesson (45 min)</p>
<p>Choose a simple lesson topic and apply backwards lesson design.  You
won’t get all the way through, but come up with a logical
progression of exercises.</p>
<p>The section you pick should require <strong>screen sharing</strong> and be of some <strong>follow-along
task</strong> (preferably using a shell).</p>
<p>Some suggestions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Regular expressions</p></li>
<li><p>Making papers in LaTeX</p></li>
<li><p>Making figures in your favorite programming language</p></li>
<li><p>Linux shell basics</p></li>
<li><p>Something non-technical, such as painting a room</p></li>
<li><p>Some aspect from an already existing lesson</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://enccs.se/lessons/">An ENCCS lesson</a> (or an episode therein)</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-shell/">Unix shell in a HPC context</a> (or an episode therein)</p></li>
<li><p>A lesson you always wanted to teach</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Exercise (30 minutes):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Collect notes in a shared document.</p></li>
<li><p>Start with learner personas and learning outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p>Come up with a logical progression of exercises.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Discussion (15 minutes):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How does this approach compare to other lessons or courses you have designed?</p></li>
<li><p>We read, compare, and discuss our notes.</p></li>
