We don't have to worry about details in the infographic above, it's just to show that there’s no single theory of learning. Different disciplines organise how we process and retain knowledge in various ways, and with multiple types of learning, multiple theories are relevant. Learning theories help us structure what we know and guide us toward effective learning. This lesson focuses on a few key concepts that are easy to translate into concrete actions in a learning environment.


## What you will learn here

ENCCS, CodeRefinery and The Carpentries all teach computational competences to learners through 
an applied approach founded on research-based teaching principles.
Usually, we avoid the theoretical and general in favor of the practical and specific. By 
showing learners how to solve specific problems with specific tools and providing hands-on 
practice, we develop learners’ confidence and empower them to start applying new knowledge 
immediately.

- Learners need to practice what they are learning in real time and get **feedback** on what they are doing. That is why the teaching approach relies on **live coding**.
- Learners best learn in a respectful and motivating classroom environment, so it's important to use a **Code of Conduct** and avoid certain demotivating language. 
- Learners are encouraged to **help each other and collaborate** during workshops as this improves their confidence and reinforces concepts taught.


### Specific aspects 

- Teaching material (lessons) available in advance and not PDF slides.
- Lessons suitable also for self study.
- Interactive, hands-on teaching: presentations and type-alongs interleaved with exercises.
- Shared collaborative workshop document for questions, answers, information etc.
- Clearly defined teaching roles (instructor, host, answering questions in shared document, ...)
- Recruiting volunteer helpers and instructors.
- Frequently asking for and encouraging feedback.
- Emphasis on code of conduct and inclusivity.
- Thoughtful screen sharing and shell sharing.
- Lessons developed from well defined learning objectives.
- Using a standard lesson template.
- Collaborative lesson development and peer review on GitHub.
- Lessons are open source instead of private.

`````{challenge} How common are these practices?

How many of the teaching features above do you use in your own teaching? 

The instructor can copy-paste the list below to the shared workshop document and conduct a poll.
