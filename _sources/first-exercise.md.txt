# First teaching practice

Before commencing the walkthrough of this instructor training material, we will try to create a mental reference point to how we currently approach teaching, and also to how we currently provide feedback to other teachers. At the very end of the workshop we will have a similar exercise, and it will be interesting to compare our experiences before and after covering the lesson. 

```{challenge} Initial teaching and feedback experience (20 minutes)

- In groups of two, take turns to "teach" a topic close to your heart to your collaborator. This can be a topic you know well, that you've taught before, or that you want to teach in the future.
- Keep it short, around 3-5 minutes. Try to be concrete and hands-on. It can involve shell commands, programming, navigating a graphical user interface or using a computational tool.
- The other person listens and optionally tries to type along (if relevant).
- The listener then provides feedback on the teaching. What went well, what could be improved?
- Now swap roles and repeat.
```

```{discussion} Main room discussion (10 minutes)

- What was difficult during the teaching demo? 
- Did you make mistakes that you immediately became aware of?
- How did it go when providing feedback, could you think of constructive criticism?
```
